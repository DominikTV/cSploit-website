            <h5>Goodbye my friend</h5>
            <p>Today, while I was going to school by train, my T42 stop working.</p>
            <p>I build it from a T42 and a T40 taken from the tip. It's fan needed a boost for start, every time I need to turn it on I had to blow into the fan. But it's keyboard was so comfortable... The trackpoit was so useful when coding in crowded places like trains.</p>

            <br>

            <h5>Consequences</h5>
            <p>The impact of this event on the cSploit development it's huge. I leave home at 6:00 AM and I come back from school around 7/8 PM. Usually I study with a colleague from 9 PM to 11 PM.</p>
            <p>The time I can spend on cSploit is now drastically reduced.</p>
            <p>Another consequence is that I was using the T42 as wireless bridge between my LAN and my neighborhood WiFi (without his agreement ;) ). Now I have to use the limited bandwith of my mobile data plan.</p>

            <br>
            <h5>Solutions</h5>
            <p>I can spend some time on trying to repair the T42, but this is the period for partial exams, I cannot do it right now. Another solution is to buy an used thinkpad. But I have to work about a month for earn enought (I'm not working so much because I want to graduate this year).</p>
