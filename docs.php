          <h2>Documentation</h2>
            <p>Welcome to the offcial cSploit documentations page.</p>
            <br />
            <h4>Current project status</h4>
            <p>We are in a delicate first phase of this project and we are not stable, yet. Currently we are moving many parts of the code into a new core. Even if you see a release marked as release, this does not mean that it has no bugs. My apologies for that, I'm doing my best to achieve a stable app :)</p>
            <br />
            <h4>Possible error</h4>
            <p>A short error message isn't often self-explanatory. Sometimes it too difficult to explain an issue with a short message and here you can find a few common examples that explain some errors:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>- cannot start process: this message is printed when the core of cSploit cannot start the required process.</li>
              <li>- <b>cmd</b> returned <b>#number</b>: this message is printed when <b>cmd</b> has exited with an error code <b>number</b></li>
              <li>- <b>cmd</b> killed by signal <b>number</b>: this message is printed when <b>cmd</b> has been killed by signal <b>number</b></li>
            </ul>
            <p>The errors above are bugs that are specific for your device. Hence, please report them if no one already has.</p>
            <br />
            <h4>Reporting bugs</h4>
            <p>I'm human, thus I can fail. This is why we need a good issue tracker like the one provided by github. I'm working on an automated way of reporting bugs directly from the app just by clicking on a button. Until then you have to manually collect your logcat and share it on the <a href="https://github.com/cSploit/android/issues">github issues page</a>.</p>

            <h4>FAQ</h4>
            <div class="section">
              <h5>Is cSploit the same as dSploit?</h5>
              <p>The basic code is the same but I'm continuing the development since dSploit has been officially merged into zANTI2.</p>
