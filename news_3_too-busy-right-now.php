            <h5>Background</h5>
            <p>On 03-09-2014 someone stole my motorbike while I was studying in my campus.</p>

            <br>

            <h5>My targets</h5>
            <ul>
              <li>- purchase a new motorbike<i class="tiny material-icons">done</i></li>
              <li>- graduate</li>
            </ul>

            <br>

            <h5>My efforts</h5>
            <p>Starting from March/April I said to all my friends that I will no more exit with them for have our usual fun. I bought 2 Kg of rice at 2 â‚¬, eating just 100g of white rice per day. I started working more, acquiring new clients and accepting a lot of works.</p>
            
            <br>
            
            <h5>My wins</h5>
            <p>Around 24-05-2015 I bought a new motorbike. I bought an used one, I don't like it so much. But it's a motorbike, that's enought for now :)</p>

            <br>
            
            <h5>My school</h5>
            <p>I'm taking many courses to finish my lower-level graduation. 3 of these require to build a project. for June I have to:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>- build a website</li>
              <li>- build a complex system for a big company</li>
              <li>- build a game in Java</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Beside these jobs I have the exams for other courses for july:</p>

            <ul>
              <li>- Physics</li>
              <li>- Technical Physics</li>
              <li>- Mechanics</li>
              <li>- Logic Circuits</li>
              <li>- Database 1</li>
              <li>- Geometry</li>
            </ul>

            <br>
            
            <h5>My fails</h5>
            <p>I asked to my teachers if I can do the Java game alone, but they decided to not give me this possibility. Instead they choose a guy from the heap and told me to work with him. One thing that I love of the internet is that I can judge people by what they say and do, choosing the right collaborators for my project. My collabolator for the Java game doesn't have any programming skills, and (for now) isn't eager to learn. That will cause me to work twice to achieve a good vote.</p>

            <br>
            
            <h5>Unexpected things</h5>
            <p>Personally I thought I was a good Object-Oriented programmer. I was wrong. The course of Sotware Engineering is improving a lot my OOP skills.</p>

            <br>
            
            <h5>cSploit and Me</h5>
            <p>I love cSploit and the main targets that this app have. I want to keep working on it. Making it better and with more features. Sadly for the above reasons I havn't time to work on it right now. I will resume working on it in a pair of months. Really As Soon As Possible :)</p>
